# Structuring LD Search Results Using PSLThis repository contains code and pointers to data to enable you to re-create the results from  Structuring LD Search Results experiments in our paper. We also provide <a href="https://github.com/duhai-alshukaili/StructuringLDSearchResults/blob/master/experimental_note.pdf">supplementary material</a> to the paper which provides additional details about the experimental evaluation.## Downloading the datasetBefore running the code of the experiments you need to download the associated dataset. To do so please run the following command:```Bash./fetchData.sh```This will download a file named data.zip and will extract the content of this file to a folder named “data”## Compiling the code## Running the inference experiments
